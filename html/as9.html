<P>A computer is a machine that can be instructed to carry out sequences of arithmetic or logical operations automatically via computer programming. Modern computers have the ability to follow generalized sets of operations, called programs. These programs enable computers to perform an extremely wide range of tasks.</P>
<a id="CPU">
<H5>CPU</H5>
<P>A central processing unit (CPU), also called a central processor or main processor, is the electronic circuitry within a computer that carries out the instructions of a computer program by performing the basic arithmetic, logic, controlling, and input/output (I/O) operations specified by the instructions</P>
	
<H5>ALU</H5>
<a id="ALU">
<P>An arithmetic logic unit (ALU) is a digital circuit used to perform arithmetic and logic operations. It represents the fundamental building block of the central processing unit (CPU) of a computer. Modern CPUs contain very powerful and complex ALUs.</P>

<h3> PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES</h3>
<a id="PL">
<P>A programming language is a vocabulary and set of grammatical rules for instructing a computer or computing device to perform specific tasks.Program langages can be used to  create program.</P>

<h5> C<sup>++</sup></h5>
<a id="cpp">
<P>C++ is a general purpose programming language and widely used now a days for competitive programming. It has imperative, object-oriented and generic programming features. C++ runs on lots of platform like Windows, Linux, Unix, Mac etc.</FONT></P>
